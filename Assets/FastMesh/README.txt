These 3D models, all created with "Fast Mesh - 3D Asset Creation Tool", demonstrate the ease of creating 
Low Poly meshes. Although FastMesh is mainly designed for creating simple 3D models, not complex humanoid 
characters, this asset allows you to easily and quickly create models of simple human figures, as shown 
in the examples.
